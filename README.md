As part of the 12-week full-time data science bootcamp I attended in the summer of 2017, I built 2 Shiny dashboards, one of which emanated after scraping tripadvisor.com for NYC restaurant ranking data with Selenium and Python. Because I love wining and dining, I decided to blend my passion for data science and programming with these topics, and hope you'll derive a modicum of unexpected insight, or at least enjoyment, from them.
